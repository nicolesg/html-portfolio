    <h2>About me<h2>
    <p>From art to tech! <br>
            
       I started my professional journey creating oil paintings and I'm now working with stained glass painting. <br>
       While involved with art work, I stumbled across the tech world and fell in love with it.<br>
       As I'm studying and learning a lot about website development and working hard to become a full stack, <br>I look forward to
       my first working experience in the tech world. <br>            
       I have great communication skills and enjoy team working a lot.</p>
